# Wine Analysis Project

## Introduction
This project aims to analyze a wine dataset and explore the factors influencing the price, popularity, and quality of wine. The dataset used for this analysis is sourced from Kaggle and can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mysarahmadbhat/wine-tasting).

### Dataset Description
The dataset consists of various variables, including:
- Country
- Description 
- Designation wine/grape variety
- Points of wine taster's rating
- Price (per bottle in dollars)
- Province - production state/region
- Region_1, Region_2 - grape-growing region
- Tester_name - wine taster's full name
- Tester_twitter_handler - wine taster's Twitter handle
- Title - wine name
- Variety - wine/grape variety
- Winery - winery name


## General Conclusions
During the study, we analyzed the wine market and found that grape variety influences both the popularity and price of wine, while the production region does not.
